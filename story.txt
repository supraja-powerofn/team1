Hi, readers!

Timmie Willie is a country mouse who is accidentally transported to a city in a vegetable basket.
When he wakes up, he finds himself in a party and makes a friend.
When he is unable to bear the city life, he returns to his home but invites his friend to the village.
When his friend visits him, something similar happens.

Humans have been living without cities or villages for most of history.
That means that both village and city life are recent inventions.
And just like every other invention, we need to decide their costs and benefits.

This popular story is about a hare , which is known to move quickly and a tortoise, which is known to move slower.

The story began when the hare who has won many races proposed a race with the tortoise. The hare simply wanted to prove that he was the best and have the satisfaction of beating him.

The tortoise agreed and the race began.

The hare got a head-start but became overconfident towards the end of the race. His ego made him believe that he could win the race even if he rested for a while.

--Gagan
The moral of the story is 'Slow and Steady wins the race'
